    "Property valuations are usually costly and take time to prepare. Buyers and sellers of properties generally resort to comparing recent transaction prices of nearby and similar properties to estimate the property value. However, there are several limitations to this approach. Firstly, there might be limited transactions within the nearby vicinity. Secondly, the evaluation of similarity between properties is highly subjective, with a wide range of factors that might contribute to the final transaction price of a particular property.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Singapore, a property valuation report is required and can only be requested after an Option To Purchase (OTP) is granted by the seller of a HDB unit to the buyer. The amount of loan that the buyer can take up will depend on the property value as stated in the valuation report, or the offer price stated in the OTP, whichever lower. A buyer may potentially face the situation where the offer price is higher than the valuation price, therefore requiring an upfront additional cash payment for the difference in value. If the buyer decides to not exercise the OTP, he/she will be forfeiting the deposit paid as part of the OTP. As such, the buyer will face significant financial risk if the assessment of the property price is not conducted diligently. On the other hand, a common challenge faced by sellers are the price setting of properties. Overpricing and underpricing properties will often result in loss of profit or prolonged holding of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, this project aims to develop a predictive model to provide both sellers and buyers a quick and easy way to estimate a property's value without spending a single cent. However, as the focus of this project is to develop a predictive model with high accuracy, we will not be delving deep into the effects of various predictors on the estimated price."

The private housing market generally consist of condominiums or landed property developed by private property developers, and does not have any restrictions or requirements in regards to the buyers' citizenship. In contrast, public housing in Singapore is managed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB), and usually are on a 99-years leasehold basis. These high-rise apartments or flats are generally located within housing estates, which are self-contained satellite towns with schools, supermarkets and other facilities. These residential properties accounts for over 80% of the Singapore Resident population's housing needs<sup>[[1](#Ref1)]</sup>, and are called HDB Flats. However, HDB flats and are only available for purchase to Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents. \n",

The price of the new HDB flat is set by the government agency and the entire process from application to occupation takes around two to four years.

    "Resale price have dipped sharply from 2017 to 2018, and continued to decline from 2018 to 2019. The relative high resale price in 2017 can be attributed to the 'en bloc' fever that started in 2016 and peaked in 2017. In March 2017, the Singapore Government have relaxed certain measures for property sellers such as reducing the amount of Seller's Stamp Duty<sup>[[4](#Ref4)]</sup>. These measures arguably increased the supply of HDB Resale Flats and drove down the resale price. \n",
    "\n",
    "In July 2018, the Singapore Government introduced more property cooling measures such as increasing the Additional Buyer Stamp Duty and reducing the Loan-To-Value limit, effectively resulting in buyer's required to pay more tax and getting less loan for property purchases<sup>[[5](#Ref5)]</sup>. These probably drove the property prices further into decline. The steadily increasing interest rates for home loans over the years arguably also cemented the declining trend for HDB Flat resale prices. \n",

    "Even though it seems that there is a slight recovery from 2019 to 2020, the number of transactions and the fluctuation of the error bar suggest that the trend can still go either ways.

Applications of transactions recorded in March seems to have the highest resale price, whereas resale prices are lowest in December. Currently we have yet to uncover any compelling reason behind this trend, but there might be a few potential confounders to take note of. \n",

    "As HDB Flats have a minimum occupancy period of 5 years (owners need to stay in the flat for at least 5 years before they can sell the flat, unless for some exceptional situations), December to March maybe a period where new and highly-sought after projects launch 5 years ago where made available to the resale market. And given the time from searching a new property by a buyer to the actual application of the transaction usually takes 2 to 6 months, we can deduce that there are more property buyers in the market from November to January.\n",
